## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flex-box
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was a nice practice, and I was able to revise my CSS skills, namely media queries and flex-box. Also used setInterval which allows output to change with the input.

### Continued development

I will try to use more flex-box, less media queries and follow CSS best practices in my next challenge.
